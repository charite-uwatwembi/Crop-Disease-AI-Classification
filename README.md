# Crop Disease Classification using Neural Networks

## Overview
This project aims to classify crop diseases using a simple neural network and an optimized neural network model. The dataset consists of images of healthy and diseased crops, which are processed using convolutional neural networks (CNN).

## Dataset
The dataset used is a collection of images categorized into various diseases affecting crops like tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers.

## Instructions to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have Python installed along with necessary libraries (TensorFlow, NumPy, etc.).
3. Run the `notebook.ipynb` to train and evaluate the models.
4. To load the saved models, use `model1.pkl` for the simple neural network and `model2.pkl` for the optimized neural network.

## Results Summary
- **Simple Model** achieved an accuracy of X% on the test dataset.
- **Optimized Model** with batch normalization, dropout, and Adam optimizer with learning rate scheduling achieved an accuracy of Y%.
